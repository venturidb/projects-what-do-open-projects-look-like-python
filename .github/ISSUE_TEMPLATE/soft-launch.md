Congrats, @______! Your Project is officially ready for soft launch. It is live here: _______

Soft launch means we've marked it live but haven't broadcast it out yet via social or email. We'll wait for a few dozen completions, complete with student feedback and ratings, which we'll decide to act upon if necessary. This feedback will be posted here by me periodically over the next few weeks so keep an eye out as you will be responsible for making the fixes. Note that the criteria for hard launch is an average rating of 4.3 with >= 25 ratings. You will be paid your prepayment upon hard launch.

You are welcome to share the Project amongst your network with a note that the Project is in soft launch and that feedback is welcome.

Can you provide an estimate on how long it took to create your Project in hours? Please include everything from first contact with DataCamp, which includes the application process.

Congrats, once again! ðŸŽ‰
