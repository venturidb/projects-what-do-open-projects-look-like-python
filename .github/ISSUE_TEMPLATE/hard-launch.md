Congrats, @______! Your Project is officially read for hard launch. Again, it is live here: _______

Hard launch means the Project is ready to be marketed to our students, which also means you will receive your prepayment. I've notified our accounting department who usually process the payment within the next week. Please contact accounting@datcamp.com if you have any questions.

Congrats, once again! ðŸŽ‰
